# Java and SQL Project

This project is developed in Java and SQL, combining elements of both frontend and backend development. The main objective is to implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a form to interact with the SQL database.

## Functionality

The project aims to provide the following functionality:

- **Create:** Users can input data through a form and create new entries in the SQL database.
- **Read:** Users can retrieve data from the database and display it.
- **Update:** Users can modify existing data in the database through the form.
- **Delete:** Users can remove entries from the database.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using Java for the backend logic and SQL for data storage and retrieval. The frontend elements are designed to facilitate user interaction with the database.

Currently, only the "Create" operation is fully functional. The form allows users to input data, which is then stored in the SQL database. However, the other CRUD operations are yet to be implemented.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the required dependencies and environment for Java and SQL.
3. Execute the project file.
4. Access the form through the provided URL or local server.

Please note that additional configuration and setup may be required depending on your specific environment.

## Future Development

In the future, the project aims to implement the remaining CRUD operations, allowing users to perform full data management through the form. Additionally, improvements to the frontend design and user experience are planned.

Contributions and feedback are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help enhance the project.
